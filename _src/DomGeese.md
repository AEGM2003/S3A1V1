## Fun Facts

1. Domestic geese can't fly due to being bred for a more upright stance and heavier body weight, but a goose can easily break your nose with one well-placed flap of its wings.


2. Geese who have been separated for even a short period of time will greet each other  (and their humans) by honking and stretching out their neck or flapping their wings.
