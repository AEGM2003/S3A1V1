## Fun Facts

1. Notoriously aggressive, Canada Geese won’t back down when they feel threatened. If it thinks its goslings or nest are in danger, it will stretch out its neck, spread its wings out wide, and hiss as it pumps its head up and down.


2. They typically forage in groups and on land, where they mostly feed on a wide variety of plant material. In the water, the birds eat aquatic plants and the occasional crustacean, mollusk, or fish.
