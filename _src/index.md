While these spiky barbs might look and even function like teeth, they do not fall under the category of teeth owing to the material they’re made of.

“Teeth are made from enamel and these spiky-looking structures are made from cartilage – known as tomia (singular tomium).”

Geese teeth, also called conical papillae, are arranged along the tongue and can work with the bill to improve cutting. Some geese even have the barbs at the back of the tongue to prevent food they’re trying to ingest from being regurgitated, a purpose which explains why the throats of turtles are such a hellscape, too.

## fun facts

1. Having tomia on their beak and tongue helps them to rip and pull roots, stems, grasses and aquatic plants from the ground.
2. Ducks, geese and swans (Anatidae) all have a similar type of tomia which helps with holding and ripping vegetation.”
